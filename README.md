# tractoremissionstracker

The project was about tracking tractor emissions using two modules

We 3D printed the case to be put next to the exhaust of the tractor and it'll be wired to the arduino that would be placed in the tractor's dashboard. We used MQ-135 sensor and that was how we're getting the information.
